# Chapter 1 – The Fundamentals of Testing

## Key Ideas
WHY SOFTWARE FAILS
- Errors are incorrect thought, a wrong assumption or a thing that is forgotten or not considered.
- Errors can lead to defects.
- Defects are faults or bugs (ex. problems in the code).
- Defects (faulty components built into a system) can lead to failures.
- Failures are visable incorrect behaviours.
- Testing contrubite to both avoidance and identification of failure.

## Check of Understanding
Q: Describe the interaction between errors, defects and failues.

*A: An error is a mistake, that creates a defect in the code, which can cause a failure when the software is used.*


Q: Software failures can cause losses. Give three consequences of software failures.

*A: 1 -Software failures can cause financial loss for a company. 2 - Software failures can damage a company’s reputation and customer trust. 3 - Software failures can cause safety risks in critical systems.*


Q: What are the verticles of the 'resources triangle'?

*A: The three vertices of the resources triangle are time, money, and quality.*

## Terminology
*false positive* - failure in the test but application or system performing correctly.

*false negative* - when there is a real failure but nothing is identified and test is seen as correct.
