# Chapter 1 – The Fundamentals of Testing

## Key Ideas
WHY SOFTWARE FAILS
- Errors are incorrect thought, a wrong assumption or a thing that is forgotten or not considered.
- Errors can lead to defects.
- Defects are faults or bugs (ex. problems in the code).
- Defects (faulty components built into a system) can lead to failures.
- Failures are visable incorrect behaviours.
- Testing contrubite to both avoidance and identification of failure.

## Terminology
*false positive* - failure in the test but application or system performing correctly.

*false negative* - when there is a real failure but nothing is identified and test is seen as correct.
