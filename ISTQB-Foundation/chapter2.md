## Key Ideas
TESTING WITH SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT MODELS
  - Documentation or code can be work products. They will become the product when the system is declared ready for release.

- A development life cycle for a software product involves:
  - capturing the initial requirments from the customer
  - explanding on initial requirments to provide detials required for code production
  - writing the code
  - testing the product
  - product release
 
  - Checking throughout the life cycle include verfication and vaildation.
